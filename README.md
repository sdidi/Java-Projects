This simple app tests the following:
1. SpringBoot with Redis - [in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. A type of NoSQL database used to optimize performance].
2. Spring Boot with ThymeLeaf - a Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 Template Engine that can work both in web (Servlet-based) and non-web environments. Used to provide Spring Framework integration.
3. Revise the RestFUl web services - uses the JSON REST end-points as an alternative to handling Http requests.
4. Spring Boot with Aspect oriented programming (AOP)  - used to separate cross-cutting concerns ( i.e functions that span multiple points of an application) from the business logic. Examples of such functionality is: Logging (as in this example), transaction management, security etc. With AOP the common functionality is define in one place, and declare how and where this functionality is applied using a configuration or annotation. The responsibility of an aspect class is to discharge advice and there are 5 types of advice: Before, After, Around, After returning and After throwing advice. in this example I used before advice.
