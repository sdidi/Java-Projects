1. SpringBoot with Redis - [in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. A type of NoSQL database used to optimize performance].
2. Spring Boot with ThymeLeaf - a Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 Template Engine that can work both in web (Servlet-based) and non-web environments. Used to provide Spring Framework integration.
3. Revise the RestFUl web services - uses the JSON REST end-points as an alternative to handling Http requests.
